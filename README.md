# community-topics

This repository contains topics that will be discussed in the weekly Ansible Community IRC Meetings.

If you want to discuss an idea, improvements or submitted new Policy/Proposals & New Collection Inclusion Requests then create a new issue on this repo as a topic. 

[Discussions for Ansible Meetings](https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues)

Community Meeting summaries/minutes and logs are posted to https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/539 after every meeting.

## Process for handling meeting topics

1. Every agenda item is created as an issue in this repository.
2. The agenda (https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/539) is locked, and only meeting summaries/minutes are posted.
3. All steering committee members can add/remove labels, and we use labels to denote priorities, area of topic, and add `next_meeting` if we think this should be discussed in the next meeting.
4. At the meeting, we look at the list of open issues, and issues with `next_meeting` get first priority.
    * Currently we assume that the list of open issues won't be too long, and that not too many will have a `next_meeting` label, so we don't need a fully defined process on how to select topics for the meeting.
    * If we find out that this assumption isn't good, we can re-evaluate/discuss this in a meeting.
