# community-topics

[![Discuss on Matrix at #community:ansible.com](https://img.shields.io/matrix/community:ansible.com.svg?server_fqdn=ansible-accounts.ems.host&label=Discuss%20on%20Matrix%20at%20%23community:ansible.com&logo=matrix)](https://matrix.to/#/#community:ansible.com)

This repository contains topics that will be discussed and voted by the Ansible Community (all interested people) and the [Ansible Community Steering Committee](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/steering/community_steering_committee.html) asynchronously.

The **scope** of the topics is changes impacting the Ansible community, contributor experience, Ansible Community package, and community collections.

If you want to discuss something that satisfies the scope then create a new [topic](https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues) or comment on [existing](https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues) one.

You do **NOT** need any special status (for example, to be a Steering Committee member) to create the topics or take part in the discussions asynchronously in the topics or in the meetings (see below). Any opinions are equally welcome and appreciated!

## Community meetings

Some of the topics can be additionally discussed in the weekly Community Meetings though final decisions are always made by **asynchronous** voting in the topics.

See the Community Working Group meeting [schedule](https://github.com/ansible/community/blob/main/meetings/README.md#wednesdays) and join us in any of the following bridged channels:
* on [Matrix](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/communication.html#ansible-community-on-matrix): [#community:ansible.com](https://matrix.to/#/#community:ansible.com)
* on [LiberaChat IRC](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/communication.html#ansible-community-on-irc): `#ansible-community`

Meeting summaries are posted in the [Community Working Group Meeting Agenda issue](https://github.com/ansible/community/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Ameeting_agenda+label%3Acommunity+label%3Acontributor_experience).

## Process for handling the community topics

The process of handling the topics is described in the:
* [Ansible Community Steering Committee policy](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/steering/community_steering_committee.html)
* [Community Topics Workflow document](https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/blob/main/community_topics_workflow.md)
