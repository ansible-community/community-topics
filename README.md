# community-topics

[![Discuss on Matrix at #community:ansible.com](https://img.shields.io/matrix/community:ansible.com.svg?server_fqdn=ansible-accounts.ems.host&label=Discuss%20on%20Matrix%20at%20%23community:ansible.com&logo=matrix)](https://matrix.to/#/#community:ansible.com)

This repository historically contained topics to be discussed and voted by the Ansible Community (all interested people) and the [Ansible Community Steering Committee](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/steering/community_steering_committee.html) asynchronously.

The **scope** of the topics was changes impacting the Ansible community, contributor experience, Ansible Community package, and community collections.

We decided to discuss those topics in the [Ansible forum](https://forum.ansible.com) in the future. However, we will not move the existing discussions to the forum and will keep to work on them here.

From now on, if you want to discuss something that satisfies the scope then [create a new topic](https://forum.ansible.com/new-topic?title=topic%20title&body=topic%20body&category=project&tags=community-wg) tagged with `community-wg` under the `Project Discussions` category or [comment on an existing one](https://forum.ansible.com/search?expanded=true&q=%23project%20tags%3Acommunity-wg).

You do **NOT** need any special status (for example, to be a Steering Committee member) to create the topics or take part in the discussions asynchronously in the topics or in the meetings (see below). Any opinions are equally welcome and appreciated!

## Community meetings

Some of the topics can be additionally discussed in the weekly Community Meetings though final decisions are always made by **asynchronous** voting in the topics.

See the Community Working Group meeting [schedule](https://github.com/ansible/community/blob/main/meetings/README.md#wednesdays) and join us in any of the following bridged channels:
* on [Matrix](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/communication.html#ansible-community-on-matrix): [#community:ansible.com](https://matrix.to/#/#community:ansible.com)
* on [LiberaChat IRC](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/communication.html#ansible-community-on-irc): `#ansible-community`

Meeting summaries are posted in the [Community Working Group Meeting Agenda issue](https://github.com/ansible/community/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Ameeting_agenda+label%3Acommunity+label%3Acontributor_experience).

## Process for handling the community topics

The process of handling the topics is described in the:
* [Ansible Community Steering Committee policy](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/steering/community_steering_committee.html)
* [Community Topics Workflow document](https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/blob/main/community_topics_workflow.md)
