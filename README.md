# community-topics

This repository contains topics that will be discussed and voted by the Ansible Community and the [Ansible Community Steering Committee](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/steering/community_steering_committee.html) asynchronously.

If you want to discuss an idea, improvements or submit new Policy/Proposals & New Collection Inclusion Requests then create a new [issue](https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues) in this repo as a topic.

## Process for handling meeting topics

1. Every agenda item is created as an issue in this repository.
2. The agenda (https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/539) is locked, and only meeting summaries/minutes are posted.
3. All steering committee members can add/remove labels, and we use labels to denote priorities, area of topic, and add `next_meeting` if we think this should be discussed in the next meeting.
4. At the meeting, we look at the list of open issues, and issues with `next_meeting` get first priority.
    * Currently we assume that the list of open issues won't be too long, and that not too many will have a `next_meeting` label, so we don't need a fully defined process on how to select topics for the meeting.
    * If we find out that this assumption isn't good, we can re-evaluate/discuss this in a meeting.

## Community meetings

Some of the topics can be additionally discussed in the weekly Community Meetings though final decisions are always made by **asynchronous** voting in the topics.

See the Community Working Group meeting [schedule](https://github.com/ansible/community/blob/main/meetings/README.md#wednesdays) and join us in any of the following bridged channels:

* on [LiberaChat IRC](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/communication.html#ansible-community-on-irc): `#ansible-community`

Meeting summaries are posted in the [Community Working Group Meeting Agenda issue](https://github.com/ansible/community/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Ameeting_agenda+label%3Acommunity+).
